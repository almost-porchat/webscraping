# Guiamais Scraper
### A webscraper for the website Guia Mais.

This is a small project for a webscraper that's able to extract query information from the brazilian website 'Guia Mais'.
It's rather simple, it parses the html for a query and fetches the data and outputs to a .csv in a formatted way.

To run this you'll need BeautifulSoup so run:
   
   ```shell
   pip3 install BeautifulSoup
   ```
